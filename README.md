# FYP
Fourth Year Project

# Description

This is the python script I used to create an AI that can play Blizzard's Starcraft 2 game.
The script utilises the Starcraft 2 client as well as an API that allows developers to design
behaviours and strategies for RTS agents

# Dependencies

python 3.6.8

Starcraft 2 Client - Free to download with a Battle.Net account

python-sc2 - https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2
Note: Master branch of python-sc2 is behind the development branch
"pip install https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2/archive/develop.zip"
to get the one that is compatible with the current Starcraft 2 client.
